The idea here is to create a hangman game. It must have:

- [x] Selectable player count that will adjust both the number of players and the number of rounds
- [x] Difficulty selector that will adjust the length/difficulty of the words
- [x] The game will end when either you guess the word or you run out of guesses
- [x] Prompt the players for names
- [x] Use the players' names in the game interaction and a congratulations message to the winner
- [x] Prompt for replay at the end of the game with the ability to change the players names or not

Your script will show initiative if you can implement:

- Is made using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Graphic User Interface (GUI) (**note:** If you are creating graphics there is ang chance that your project will fail
  the tests initiated by clicking
  the 'Check'. This may not be a problem, however, I would stringly suggest you make the game comply to the text
  criteria first and add graphics after)
- Anything interesting that we have yet to cover

** __NOTE__ **
You are free to search for solutions to problems you encounter. If you implement even parts of these solutions,
be sure to source them in the comments.

Use this [flowchart](file://tasks/hangman/hangman_flowchart.jpeg) to guide you in the development of the game. Each
part of the chart can be dealt with separately.

### Tools

These concepts will be helpful in solving the task::

- Variables
- User input function
- F strings
- Conditional logic
- Module import (random)

## Handing in your work

Before you hand in be sure the Check button shows that your solution is correct. This looks through your console output
from the gameplay for certain prompts so if you have used any GUI libraries please make have a console output as well
as a GUI so that the 'Check' has something to look at.
