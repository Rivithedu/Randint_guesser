Your script must:
- [x] Ask user for name
- [x] Generate a secret random number between 1 and 50 (or has difficulty levels ex. 1-10,1-20, etc.)
- [x] Prompt the user to guess the number
- [x] Prompt the user to re-guess if incorrect and guides the user whether the previous guess 
was high or low
- [x] Count the guesses
- [x] Congratulate the user when correct guess occurs with the number of total guesses
- [x] Prompt the user to play again
- [x] include main block

    ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

Your script will show initiative if you can implement:
-	Is made using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
-	Has Graphic User Interface (GUI using TKinter or any other library that provides simple graphics. **note:** If you are creating graphics there is ang chance that your project will fail the tests initiated by clicking
the 'Check'. This may not be a problem, however, I would stringly suggest you make the game comply to the text 
criteria first and add graphics after)
-	Has anything that I can not think of currently

** **NOTE:** **
Be careful to not "borrow" any code in this circumstance. I need to see what you are capable of at this
point. This is a task that is well bellow what we have seen in the intro course but will show your basic
coding skills and structural understanding of python.
___
### Tools
These concepts will be helpful in solving the task:
- Variables
- User input function
- Loops
- Module import (random)
- Conditional logic
- F strings
- Classes and Objects (if you choose to use OOP)

<div class="hint">
Use variables to store a randomly generated number
</div>

<div class="hint">
Use random module to simplify the generation of a random number. to do so use the following line at the 
top of your script <div class="code">import random</div>
</div>
