The idea here is to create a risk-free recreation of a known game. It must have:
- [x] Selectable player count that will adjust both the number of players and the number of rounds
- [x] Difficulty selector that will adjust the number of losses to the number of players minus one
- [x] Each loss will eliminate a player from the game
- [x] The game will continue until only one player remains
- [x] Prompt the players for names
- [x] Use the players' names in the game interaction and a congratulations message to the winner
- [x] Prompt for replay at the end of the game with the ability to change the players names or not

Your script will show initiative if you can implement:
- Is made using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Graphic User Interface (GUI) (**note:** If you are creating graphics there is ang chance that your project will fail the tests initiated by clicking
the 'Check'. This may not be a problem, however, I would stringly suggest you make the game comply to the text 
criteria first and add graphics after)
- Anything interesting that we have yet to cover

** __NOTE__ ** 
You are free to search for solutions to problems you encounter. If you implement even parts of these solutions,
be sure to source them in the comments.
